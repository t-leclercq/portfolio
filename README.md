# What's that, exactly

**https://tleclercq.vercel.app/**

This showcases the work i'm doing on my own, on my spare time.
This is intended for my mates, coworkers and anybody seeking to exchange about technical stuff.

## Fields i'm into

- Reverse engineering (C, C++, Rust, Go, x86 assembly)
- Web dev (easy to use data to layout components and cool UI tricks)
- Malware research (while being a newbie, i'm reading a lot on this particular field to educate myself)
- Networking (not taking about afterworks here... OSI Layer stuff only)
- CTFs (expect some writeups here in the near future)
- Automation, DevOps and other experiments

### Leonids Gatsby is the theme i used

**[Leonids](http://renyuanz.github.io/leonids)** is a clean, fixed sidebar Gatsby starter which is perfect for powering your GitHub hosted blog.
